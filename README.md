# FailureShiftRL

Briefly describe your project here. Explain what it does and why it is useful. Highlight the machine learning tasks it addresses, such as classification, generation, summarization, and reinforcement learning (RL).

> **Note:** In this branch, we use Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files exclusively to enhance code interactivity and better understanding.

## Structure

This project is organized into several key directories:

- `classification/`: Contains code and models related to the classification tasks.
- `generation/`: Contains code and models for generating text or other data.
- `summarization/`: Houses the code and models for summarizing text documents.
- `RL/`: Includes all reinforcement learning algorithms and models.
- `utils/`: Shared utilities used across the project.
- `dataset/`: Datasets used for training and evaluating the models.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Prerequisites

List everything you need to install to run the project and how to install them:
